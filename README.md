# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres
## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. The purpose of this project is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. They also require the engineer to test data and ETL pipeline by running queries and compare the results with their expected results.

## Project Datasets
### Song data:
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
### Log data:
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Implemented star schema which optimized song play analysis. This includes the following tables:
#### Fact Table:
1. songplays: records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
  - schema:
  ```
    songplay_id    - PRIMARY KEY
    start_time     - REFERENCES time (start_time)
    user_id        - REFERENCES users (user_id)
    level
    song_id        - REFERENCES songs (song_id)
    artist_id      - REFERENCES artists (artist_id)
    session_id
    location
    user_agent
  ```
#### Dimension Tables:
2. users: users profile in the app
  - schema:
  ```
  user_id          - PRIMARY KEY
  first_name
  last_name
  gender
  level
  ```
3. songs: songs in music database
  - schema:
  ```
  song_id          - PRIMARY KEY
  title
  artist_id
  year
  duration
  ```
4. artists: artists in music database
  - schema:
  ```
  artist_id        - PRIMARY KEY
  name
  location
  latitude
  longitude
  ```
5. time: timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
  - schema:
  ```
  start_time       - PRIMARY KEY
  hour
  day
  week
  month
  year
  weekday
  ```
## Files in the project
1. sql_queries.py: has all the sql code for drop, create table and insert data
2. create_tables.py: implements the sql code from sql_queries.py to drop and create tables
3. etl.py: the main file to process data pipline which extract, process and insert data to sql tables
4. test.ipynb: the python notebook to test result
## Instructions:
Step1: run create_tables.py
```
python create_tables.py
```
Step2: run elt.py
```
python etl.py
```
Step3: test result using test.ipynb
